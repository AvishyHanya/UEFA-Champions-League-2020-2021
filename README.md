UEFA Champions League 2020-2021 Data Analysis

📋 Overview
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 2020-2021 UEFA Champions League season. The goal is to uncover player performance patterns and identify key metrics that distinguish elite athletes in world football.

❓ Research Questions
How does a player's position correlate with tactical contributions (e.g., passing accuracy vs. goals)?
Which players demonstrated exceptional efficiency compared to the league average?
Is there a direct correlation between distance covered and offensive output?

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
-Python – Core programming.
-Pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation.
-Matplotlib & Seaborn – Advanced statistical visualization.

📊 Key Insights
Passing Efficiency: Analysis revealed a high density of elite passing accuracy (>90%) among specific midfielders, even under high pressure.
Work Rate: The data showed no direct linear correlation between total distance covered and goals scored, suggesting that tactical positioning outweighs sheer physical volume.
Top Performers: By visualizing goals and assists per minute, the analysis identified the most clinical players beyond basic top-scorer rankings.
